# README

My first VS Code extension because I like customization!

Inspired by [fluffy dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ayakoSky.fluffy-dark-theme) and [woody theme](https://github.com/seahyx/Woody-Theme), I want a darker background and more pink-and-green-ish colors, so here it is!
